# Quickstart

The following is a minimal guide to running writing an Extism plug-in in your language
of choice. This document should get you from `0` to `"Hello, World!"` as quickly as possible.

## Choose A Language

In Extism, your plug-in code is compiled to a binary Wasm module.
We offer a variety of libraries, which we call PDKs (Plug-in Development Kits), to help you compile
your code to a Wasm module that can be embedded in any Host SDK.

First choose a language for your plug-in:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Rust" label="Rust" default>

### Install the Dependency

Generate a new plugin using [Extism CLI](https://extism.org/docs/install):

```bash
extism gen plugin -l Rust -o plugin
```

### Create an Export

The primary means of interacting with this plug-in is an export function that can be called by the outside world.
Let's create a simple greeting plug-in. The `plugin_fn` macro wires this function to Extism and exports it
using the name `greet`:

```rust
use extism_pdk::*;

#[plugin_fn]
pub fn greet(name: String) -> FnResult<String> {
    Ok(format!("Hello, {}!", name))
}
```

### Compile the Plug-in

We can compile to the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` since we don't need to make any syscalls (not using WASI):

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

:::note Wasm32 Targets
If this fails, make sure you have added this target to rust:
> rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
:::

### Running the Plug-In

This will put your compiled wasm in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug`.
We can now test it using the [Extism CLI](https://extism.org/docs/install)'s `run`
command:

```bash
extism call target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/rust_pdk_template.wasm greet --input "Benjamin"
# => Hello, Benjamin!
```

:::note Optimize using Release Mode
You will get better performance and smaller `.wasm` binaries if you build your code using `--release`.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```
:::

### Documentation

Congrats! You just wrote your first Extism plug-in! To learn more about what this
rust library can do, see the [rust-pdk README](https://github.com/extism/rust-pdk#readme) and [reference docs](https://docs.rs/extism-pdk/latest/extism_pdk/).

  <TabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript/TypeScript">

### Install the Dependency

First install the Extism JS compiler with this install script:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/extism/js-pdk/main/install.sh
sh install.sh
```

Then run command with no args to see the help:

```bash
extism-js
error: The following required arguments were not provided:
    <input-js>

USAGE:
    extism-js <input-js> -i <interface-file> -o <output>

For more information try --help
```

:::note Mac Quarantine
If you are using mac, you may need to tell your security system this unsigned binary is fine.
:::

Then, generate a JavaScript plugin using Extism CLI:
```
extism gen plugin -l JavaScript -o plugin
cd plugin
npm install
```

Or, for a TypeScript plugin:
```
extism gen plugin -l TypeScript -o plugin
cd plugin
npm install
```

### Create an Export

The primary means of interacting with this plug-in is an export function that can be called by the outside world.
Let's create a simple greeting plug-in. Just like a normal JS module, any function we
export will be accessible to the outside world:

```javascript
function greet() {
    const name = Host.inputString()
    Host.outputString(`Hello, ${name}`)
}

module.exports = {greet}
```

We must also describe the Wasm interface for our plug-in. We do this with a typescript module DTS file. Here is our plugin.d.ts file:

```typescript
declare module 'main' {
  // Extism exports take no params and return an I32
  export function greet(): I32;
}
```

### Compile the Plug-in

Now we must compile this plug-in to wasm:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Running the Plug-In

We can now test it using the [Extism CLI](https://extism.org/docs/install)'s `run`
command:

```bash
extism call ./dist/plugin.wasm greet --input "Benjamin" --wasi
# => Hello, Benjamin
```

:::note Wasi 
At this time, all js plug-ins need WASI to run

### Install the Dependency

Generate a Go plugin using [Extism CLI](https://extism.org/docs/install):

```
extism gen plugin -l Go -o plugin
```

### Create an Export

The primary means of interacting with this plug-in is an export function that can be called by the outside world.
Let's create a simple greeting plug-in.


```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/extism/go-pdk"
)

//export greet
func greet() int32 {
	input := pdk.Input()
	greeting := `Hello, ` + string(input) + `!`
	pdk.OutputString(greeting)
	return 0
}

func main() {}
```

:::note Magic Comment
The magic comment `//export` is what exports the function to the outside world:

### Compile the Plug-in

Now we must compile this plug-in to wasm. Currently the best way to do this is with [tinygo](https://tinygo.org/):

```bash
make
```

### Running the Plug-In

We can now test it using the [Extism CLI](https://extism.org/docs/install)'s `run`
command:

  <TabItem value="C" label="C">

### Install the Dependency

The quickest way to getting started is generate a C plugin via the [Extism CLI](https://extism.org/docs/install):

```bash
extism gen plugin -l C -o plugin
cd ./plugin
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Create an Export

The primary means of interacting with this plug-in is an export function that can be called by the outside world.
Let's create a simple greeting plug-in.

```c title=src/plugin.c
#define EXTISM_ENABLE_LOW_LEVEL_API
#define EXTISM_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "../extism/extism-pdk.h"

const char *greeting = "Hello, ";
uint64_t greetingLen = 7;

int32_t greet() {
  uint64_t inputLen = extism_input_length();

  // Load input
  uint8_t inputData[inputLen];
  extism_load_input(0, inputData, inputLen);

  // Allocate a new offset used to store greeting and name
  uint64_t outputLen = greetingLen + inputLen;
  ExtismPointer offs = extism_alloc(outputLen);
  extism_store(offs, (const uint8_t *)greeting, greetingLen);
  extism_store(offs + greetingLen, inputData, inputLen);

  // Set output
  extism_output_set(offs, outputLen);
  return 0;
}
```

### Compile the Plug-in

Compile with clang and target `wasm32-unknown-unknown`:

```bash
clang -o plugin.wasm --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown -nostdlib -Wl,--no-entry -mexec-model=reactor -Wl,--export=greet ./src/plugin.c
```

:::note Exports
Note that we must explicitly export the `greet` function at compile time.
:::

:::note Makefile
You can also use the Makefile in the generated plugin. But you'll have to edit it so that the `greet` functions is exported.

### Install the Dependency

This library can be used to write [Extism Plug-ins](https://extism.org/docs/concepts/plug-in) in Haskell.

Docs are available on Hackage: [https://hackage.haskell.org/package/extism-pdk](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/extism-pdk)

## Install

Make sure you have [wasm32-wasi-ghc](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-wasm-meta) installed, then generate a Haskell plugin using the [Extism CLI](https://extism.org/docs/install):

```bash
extism gen plugin -l Haskell -o plugin
```

### Create an Export

The primary means of interacting with this plug-in is an export function that can be called by the outside world.
Let's create a simple greeting plug-in.

```haskell title=Main.hs
module Greet where

import Data.Int
import Data.Maybe
import Extism.PDK

mkGreeting :: String -> String -> IO ()
mkGreeting g n =
  output $ g ++ ", " ++ n

greet :: IO Int32
greet = do
  -- Get a name from the Extism runtime
  name <- inputString
  -- Get  configured greeting
  greeting <- getConfig "greeting"
  -- Greet the user, if no greeting is configured then "Hello" is used
  mkGreeting (fromMaybe "Hello" greeting) name
  -- Return 0 to signal success
  pure 0

foreign export ccall "greet" greet :: IO Int32
```

```haskell title=Plugin.hs
module Plugin (mkGreeting) where

import Extism.PDK

mkGreeting :: String -> String -> IO ()
mkGreeting g n =
  output $ g ++ ", " ++ n
```

### Compile the Plug-in

Compile with `wasm32-wasi-cabal`:

```bash
make
```

:::note Exports
Note that we must explicitly export the `greet` function at compile time.

  ### Install the Dependency

  Create a new Zig project:

```bash
extism gen plugin -l Zig -o plugin
```

### Create an Export

The goal of writing an [Extism plug-in](https://extism.org/docs/concepts/plug-in) is to compile your Zig code to a Wasm module with exported functions that the host application can invoke. The first thing you should understand is creating an export. Let's write a simple program that exports a `greet` function which will take a name as a string and return a greeting string. Zig has excellent support for this through the `export` keyword:

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const extism_pdk = @import("extism-pdk");
const Plugin = extism_pdk.Plugin;

const allocator = std.heap.wasm_allocator;

export fn greet() i32 {
    const plugin = Plugin.init(allocator);
    const name = plugin.getInput() catch unreachable;
    defer allocator.free(name);

    const output = std.fmt.allocPrint(allocator, "Hello, {s}!", .{name}) catch unreachable;
    plugin.output(output);
    return 0;
}
```

### Compile the Plug-in

> Note: if you started with the generated project files from `zig init`, you should delete `src/root.zig`
and any references to it if they are in your `build.zig` file.

Then run:
```sh
zig build
```

This will put your compiled wasm in `zig-out/bin`.

### Running the Plug-in

We can now test it using the [Extism CLI](https://extism.org/docs/install)'s `run`
command:

```bash
extism call ./zig-out/bin/zig-pdk-template.wasm greet --input "Benjamin"
# => Hello, Benjamin!
```
