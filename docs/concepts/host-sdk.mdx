# Host SDKs

In Extism parlance, we call the application that your plug-ins extend the _host_. e.g: in VS Code, if the extensions are the _plug-ins_ then the editor itself is the _host_. 

The library you use to manage and run plug-ins in the host is called a _Host SDK_.

### Usage

Within your program, you must add a library dependency for a Host SDK in order to execute plug-ins. Extism's officially supported SDKs are published to each language's respective primary package manager, e.g. [Crates.io](https://crates.io/users/extism-bot) for Rust, or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/org/extism) for Node.js.

If you would like to implement an SDK in another language, please refer to the [Runtime APIs](/docs/concepts/runtime-apis) section to see the functions you will need to write bindings to.

See the [Integrate into your codebase](/docs/category/integrate-into-your-codebase) section to find a Host SDK in your language, as well as installation instructions to get started.

If you are looking to build a _plug-in_ for a Host program or application, please see the [Write a Plug-in](/docs/concepts/pdk) section for more information about PDKs.
